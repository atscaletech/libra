## Overview
Blockchain is revolutionizing eCommerce, making payment safer and faster while bringing greater access to global consumers.  
Due to the nature of digital currency protocols, transactions cannot be canceled or altered once they are initiated.  
However, global eCommerce data shows that at least 30% of all products ordered online are returned.  

How can we adopt blockchain to eCommerce with such a barrier?

Libra was born to tackle this problem and help facilitate blockchain adoption in the eCommerce industry.  
Libra is decentralized payments system that empowers the next e-commerce. Through its SDK, Libra allows sellers to accept cryptocurrency payments in minutes.  
Libra includes a **Lock and Release Payment (LRP) Protocol** and **Decentralized Dispute Resolution** at its core.
LRP Protocol helps the buyer to purchase with confidence. It also helps the seller to increase conversion and do proper order handling.  
Decentralized Dispute Resolution leverages the power of blockchain and the community to resolve transaction conflict in a quick and efficient method without involving any financial institution.  

Libra bridges the gap between blockchain and eCommerce to enable all people to exchange value and transact globally, securely, at significantly lower cost, and more inclusively than traditional financial systems allow.

The project's scope is to build three core components that define the foundation of Libra Network: LRP protocol, Decentralized Dispute Resolution, and Javascript SDK. From these components, people can easily integrate the cryptocurrencies payment to their business while their customers are protected by Libra Network.
